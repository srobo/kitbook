# Roving Helper

A Roving Helper is a volunteer who wanders around the pit areas to assist teams with quick and simple problems. If an issue cannot be easily resolved then the team should be referred to [[Helpdesk]]. Ideally a Roving Helper has some experience with Student Robotics kit, but this is not essential. In most cases good knowledge of the [Docs](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs) and [Rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/rules) will suffice.

Every volunteer acting as a Roving Helper should collect a clipboard with Issue Forms on from Helpdesk. They should speak to Helpdesk for information on how to use these forms.

A Roving Helper may be requested, by [[Helpdesk]], to investigate a particular issue a team is having. This will most likely involve working through the problem with the team in their pit. In some cases it might involve observing and aiding a team over the period of a couple of matches to diagnose particularly obscure issues.
