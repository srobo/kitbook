# Communication Platforms

## Slack

Slack is a realtime messaging platform which allows for synchronous discussion
in channels and threads.

We use it for discussion, though (due to the nature of the platform) it has
limitations in this regard.

We occasionally announce things via Slack, however anything important will also
be sent via email.

You can join our Slack by filling in this [google form][slack-signup].

## Mailshots (via MailChimp)

We have a general platform for emailing both volunteers and teams in a one-way
fashion. This is used primarily for important communications where responses can
happen via another format (for example call for volunteers for an event, with
responses via a Google Form).

## Mailing lists

We have some Google Groups mailing lists which are used for higher latency
discussion and for general announcements.

## GitHub

While not strictly a communication platform, considerable discussion about
things we're working on happens in issues on GitHub. This is the case for our
[tasks][tasks] list as well as in issues and pull requests in other repositories.
