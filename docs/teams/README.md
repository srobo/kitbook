# Teams

This section contains information about the support we provide for teams
entering the competition, how we get them involved and how we communicate with
them.

Generally a single person takes on the overall responsibility for teams, though
during the competition year it is often advantageous to delegate geographical
areas to other volunteers to ensure prompt responses to enquiries and avoid
overloading a single person.
