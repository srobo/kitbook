# Game Design Coordinator

This is an overview of the game design coordinator role, intended to be read by the game design coordinator.

## Overview of Role

As game design coordinator, it is your responsibility to ensure that we end up with a suitable game design for the Student Robotics Competition Programme.  As you will find in the ops manual, your responsibilities are:

 * Designing the game.
 * Producing publishable rules for the game well in advance of Kickstart.
 * Ensuring that the details of the game are not publicly available until Kickstart.
 * Updating the published rules throughout the year in response to rule clarification requests.

## Game Selection Process

This game selection process is currently in draft-form within the ops manual.  Please do ask for a copy of this draft version, as it provides a good overview of the intended process.  In short, the new process is intended to allow volunteers to submit game ideas, whilst ensuring that it is an enjoyable process for all involved.   It consists of the following stages:

 1. "Informal discussions".
 2. "Proposals", in which people may submit descriptions of their game ideas to you.
 3. "Feedback", in which volunteers have the opportunity to read proposals, and comment **once** on their strengths and weaknesses.
 4. "Selection", in which you gather responses to criticisms from game proposal authors (after appropriately filtering and collating them), and then select a game based upon the proposals, feedback and responses.  You should also consult the Kit Coordinator regarding the technical appropriateness of each proposal.
 5. "Revision", in which you develop the final game rules, working together with the volunteer who submitted the game proposal (if they wish to participate!).

## Rules Structure

In previous years, the rules have consisted of several sections.  We are considering breaking these apart into separate documents (or web pages), to reduce the potentially overwhelming nature of the rulebook.  The resulting documents would be:

 1. Game rules, describing what the game itself is, how scoring works, as well as how each match runs.
 2. Regulations, detailing all technical requirements that robots must adhere to in order to compete.
 3. Specifications that describe the layout of the arena, and props within it.
 4. Awards.
 5. Kit return (Which parts of the kit will be returned).

Not all of the above should be your responsibility as the game design coordinator -- you are only responsible for the game rules and specifications of the props within the arena.  The other parts will be dealt with by the Kit Coordinator, Kit Support Coordiantor and Competition Programme Coordinator.  All of the above elements will be presented to teams as part of the Kit documentation, which the Kit Support Coordinator will manage.
