## Kit Disclaimer

We require every team leader to agree to and sign a disclaimer before using any of the provided kit. The source file for this disclaimer lives in the private [team-paperwork](https://bitbucket.org/srobo/team-paperwork) repo. That repo also contains scans of the signed documents from previous years.
