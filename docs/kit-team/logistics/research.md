# Research

The following sections document various bits of research that have been carried out by the Kit Logistics Coordinator while fulfilling their responsibilities.

## Return Shipping Bag

| Size (mm) | Actual size (mm) | 18l RUB fit | 9l RUB (non-XL) fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 425x600 |  | \[untested\] | \[untested\]. I suspect that it will be good, but I need to get a sample bag. |
| 525x600 | 524x610 | Does not fit | Fits easily with the box aligned with the bag. Is a tight, but comfortable, fit with the box sideways relative to the bag. It very nearly fits two boxes in sideways, but is a little too short. |
| 575x700 | 583x714 | Perfect easy fit with the box aligned with the bag | Easily fits two boxes either side-by-side or stacked (preferred due to its rigidity) |
| 600x900 | 600x900 | Easily fits with the box aligned with the bag | Easily fits three boxes. Two stacked and one on its side. It is not a particularly solid arrangement. |
| 700x850 | 700x850 | Easily fits in both orientations | Fits four boxes, stacked, pretty much perfectly. |
