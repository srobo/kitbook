## Topping up UK Postbox

UK Postbox requires topping up with credit. Budget for this comes from either the `srXXXX/post` or the `srXXXX/kits/shipping` budget lines depending on what it will generally be used for. Obviously it's not possible to know exactly how the credit will ultimately be spent so it's not critical. Since it is not possible to extract money back out of UK Postbox, top ups should be sufficient for the foreseeable future only.
