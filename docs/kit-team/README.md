# Kit Operations

As part of Competition Programme, we loan the competing teams a kit which forms
the core of their robot. This section documents how we develop and handle the
kit, including:

* [definition](./kit-definition.md) of what the kit contains
* [logistics](./logistics/README.md): getting kit to/form teams as well as tracking and storage
* [maintenance](./hardware/README.md) of the kit, including processing of the kits before and after the competition
* [software](./software/README.md) which runs on it
* [support](./support.md) provided to teams during the competition

## Kit Disclaimer

We require every team leader to agree to and sign a disclaimer before using any of the provided kit. The source file for this disclaimer lives in the private [team-paperwork](https://bitbucket.org/srobo/team-paperwork) repo. That repo also contains scans of the signed documents from previous years.
