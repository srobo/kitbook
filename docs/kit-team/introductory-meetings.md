# Introductory Meetings

The Kit Team holds online introductory meetings for new volunteers every month.

These meetings will introduce you to what the Kit Team is and how you can join it.  You'll be introduced to the mission and values of Student Robotics, and will be able to talk to Kit Team members about where you will best be able to contribute.  As part of the meeting we will work out what the best next steps are for you.

If you are interested in joining the Kit Team, then please email the Kit Team committee at [kit-committee@studentrobotics.org](mailto:kit-committee@studentrobotics.org) and they will invite you to the next introductory meeting.
