The kitbook contains documentation that is relevant to all of the
Student Robotics Kit Team.  The Kit Team's remit is defined in the
organisation's [operations manual][ops-manual], and a description of
our mission and how we divide up our work can be found in the [Kit
Team section](./kit-team) of the kitbook.

### Scope Limitations

The kitbook aims to provide general information as far as our own specific
information goes, so that it can always be a starting point for understanding.
There are many cases where it should not contain the actual documentation:

* Information about Student Robotics' structure as a charity. This instead is
  documented by the trustees in the [ops manual][ops-manual].
* Information about running the Student Robotics competition -- this
  belongs in the Competition Team's [runbook][runbook].
* Documentation about a tool, a piece of software, etc.  This belongs
  in the project relating to that thing.
