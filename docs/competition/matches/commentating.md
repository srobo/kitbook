## Roles

Here is a description of the roles related to commentating.

### Commentator

**Responsible for commentating matches and building a large amount of excitement amongst those near the arenas.**

As a commentator you will be stationed near to the arenas and able to walk freely around them. You will be given access to a PA system via a microphone for which to speak through to address the audience. It's important that you do not make announcements to volunteers through this.

Note that as a commentator you may not make decisions about the matches which would otherwise be covered by the [judge](/competition/matches/judging#Judge), including determining whether a match is paused or repeated.
