# Introductory Briefer

The introductory and H&S briefer gives a ~10m talk at the beginning of the
competition regarding matters of importance, which at a high level are:

 * Health and Safety
 * How the competition operates

In that order.

Health & Safety should cover at least:

 * Common sense (i.e., don't run everywhere)
 * Use of tools
 * Battery safety
 * Robot safety checking

The competition intro talk should:

 * Introduce tinker time
 * Explain (and illustrate) the procedure for operating the robot in a match,
   from gate to gate.
   * Especially highlight that teams must insert the USB stick provided at the staging area  **before** turning on their robot at the beginning of the match.
 * Lay down rules on who is allowed where
 * Describe tinker time and make it clear how one books tinker time.
 * Give a short overview of the game itself (more or less what is printed on the competition flyer).
