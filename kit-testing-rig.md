# Kit Testing Rig

To help with checking of potentially faulty kit, [[Helpdesk]] has a kit testing rig to allow quick and easy testing of some parts of the kit. Not all parts of the kit can be tested with the rig and so more traditional debugging methods must be employed, as documented on the [[Helpdesk]] page.

**Under no circumstances must any of the kit testing rig parts be removed from the designated table at Helpdesk. Teams must bring the part to be tested to Helpdesk.**

The testing rig consists of the following parts:

 * A laptop running the kit testing rig GUI
 * A multimeter
 * A development power board [plus an external power switch shorting plug]
 * A battery to power the power board
 * Two motors with 5mm and 7.5mm camcons attached
 * Two servos
 * A 12V 55W headlamp bulb in a jar
 * One 7.5mm to 7.5mm camcon cable
 * Two micro USB cables
 * One full-size USB cable
 * One development servo board
 * One set of Ruggeduino screw shields
 * Five LEDs with flying leads
 * Two microswitches with flying leads

The following parts of the kit can be tested with the rig: Power Board, Motor Board, Servo Board, Ruggeduino, Micro USB Cable and the Webcam. To test any of these items simply click the relevant button in the kit testing rig GUI on the laptop and follow the on-screen instructions. Note that the multimeter is not directly referenced in any of the testing procedures, it is supplied to allow measurements to be taken as the operator sees fit.
