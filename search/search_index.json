Volunteers are expected to advise teams in a similar fashion to mentoring - that is they should not tell teams what to do, but offer advice and guidance. The volunteers also help with kit related issues that may or may not be caused by a problem with the kit. It is the responsibility of the Helpdesk volunteers to assess teams' problems and, if necessary, swap out bits of kit hardware. In some situations teams may need to be put in contact with a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help diagnose and fix issues. Equipment \u00b6 Two copies of the rules - one attached to a desk by some means A copy of this document Issue forms for both Helpdesk Volunteers and Roving Helpers Kit Swap Forms Spare kit in the 'spare kit box' List of spare kit Broken kit box Issue Form box Laptop to view documentation and the IDE Red insulating tape Permanent marker Large post-it notes Radio Emergency contact number for the Health and Safety Coordinator Spare robot flags/badges for teams to borrow to try for size (must be clearly marked and returned to helpdesk ASAP) Spare robot flag pipe fittings to give to teams Saturday evening battery/charger loans Volunteer Requirements \u00b6 At least one volunteer on Helpdesk must have prior experience of the use of the Student Robotics kit. Procedures \u00b6 Almost all of Helpdesk's operations are covered by the following procedures. Handling of all requests \u00b6 Whenever a team comes to Helpdesk with an issue a Helpdesk Volunteer must fill in their TLA and a single-sentence description of the issue on an Issue Form. When the issue has been resolved a single sentence description of the resolution must be written on the form. This is primarily for analytical purposes so that we can improve the operation of Helpdesk in future years. Whenever a team comes to Helpdesk with an issue that cannot be solved instantly their TLA and a very brief (couple of words) summary of the problem must be written on a post-it note and stuck up on a board of current issues. This ensures that no problems get dropped while they are being investigated. When the issue is resolved the post-it note can be thrown away. If it appears that a particular post-it has remained on the board for an extended period of time and there has been no obvious activity to resolve the issue then a volunteer should be dispatched to the team to see if it's still a problem. Handling of requests for robot safety checks \u00b6 The robots require safety checking before they are allowed to compete in the competition. Teams will not be given their hi-viz vest until their robot has passed the safety check procedure. Helpdesk volunteers should direct teams enquiring about safety checks to the Health & Safety Coordinator. Handling of general robot development requests \u00b6 Many teams will come to Helpdesk requesting help with the development of their robot or, more likely, help using the Student Robotics kit and associated software. As mentioned earlier, Helpdesk volunteers are not expected to tell teams what to do, but rather offer advice. Helpdesk volunteers should strive to answer questions about the use of the kit and software. Some queries may require a volunteer to visit the team in their pit to observe behaviour in situ. This must only be done by a Helpdesk volunteer if it will leave no fewer than two volunteers actively manning Helpdesk. If it is not possible for a Helpdesk volunteer to visit a team then a Roving Helper should be summoned, via radio if necessary. In some rare situations it may be necessary to request the assistance of a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help solve an issue. This should only be done if the issue is non-trivial, Here is a list of people to contact for further help: List for SR2019: Electronic Hardware Rob Gilton IDE Peter Law Python API Peter Law Rob Gilton Handling suspected damaged kit requests \u00b6 If a team comes to Helpdesk with a suspicion of some of the Student Robotics kit being damaged then the following procedure should be followed: Request that the team take a freshly charged battery and see if the problem persists. Request that the team tries swapping the USB and power cables to the device in question, where applicable. If the kit contains multiple of the device in question (e.g. USB hub, motor board), request that the team tries swapping it with the other one in the kit. Request that the team tests the device in question with a very simple code project that only attempts to control that one device. If all previous steps indicate that the device is probably faulty then continue with the kit swap procedure. Swapping out kit \u00b6 After determining that a piece of kit is most likely faulty it must be swapped with a working spare. Helpdesk has a supply of spare kit. To swap a piece of kit please fill in a SR2019 Kit Swap Form and follow the instructions on there. Since there is a limited quantity of spare kit, all attempts must be made to verify that the issue being observed is not caused by something else. Handling requests for batteries/chargers/bags on Saturday evening \u00b6 Some teams may wish to work on their robot on Saturday night and will therefore require batteries, a charger, a charger PSU and a battery bag. If a team requests these items, note down their TLA and the part codes of the five items on the 'Overnight Battery Loan Form' sheet and give them the parts. On Sunday morning one helpdesk volunteer must ensure that all of the parts listed on this sheet are collected from the teams and returned to the battery charging station, and marked as returned on the form. Handling requests for batteries/chargers/bags on Sunday evening \u00b6 Some teams have been granted permission to keep the kit for a little while after the competition. To be able to make use of the kit they will require batteries, chargers, and bags. They MUST NOT be given any of these items from helpdesk. They will receive these items at the 'Kit Return Desk' when they leave. All teams must go to the Kit Return Desk, regardless of whether they are returning their kit or not, as that is where teams keeping kit will receive all the needed items. Handling requests for flag fittings \u00b6 Teams may request a pipe connector to use on their robot for the purpose of attaching the robot flags. As we have a limited supply, make sure that you only let each team only take one, so that they can't keep coming back for more. Also, please show teams how to remove the fittings, as they are very strong and need to be released in the correct way (Press down on the center ring) Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 Based on issues handled in previous years, the following may be helpful: Key phrase Resolution \"Failed to dequeue buffer Assertion 'frame != ((void*0)' failed\" There was a problem with the webcam. Make sure it's plugged in. Make sure the webcam is plugged directly into the brain board (not via a USB hub). If the problem keeps occurring, try swapping out the webcam (following the procedure). Need to initialise servos to non-zero position Use 'Custom Robot Object Initialisation' and set position between .init() and .wait_start() . (On 'Programming->sr' page of docs near the bottom) How to access starting corner/zone number in code Use 'R.zone' (On 'Programming->sr' page of docs in the 'Other Robot Attributes' section) Worried about token/marker offset of 100 in competition mode We handle this automatically, they do not need to worry. If their code works in development mode with development markers, it will work in competition mode with competition markers. They must ensure that they plug the arena/competition key provided to them in the staging area into their robot before they turn the power on.","title":"Helpdesk"},{"location":"competition/team-support/helpdesk/#helpdesk","text":"Please note that this page is obsolete: It is a remnant from old documentation, and will be replaced-with/integrated-into the relevant project team's documentation when possible Helpdesk is the teams' primary source of support.

Organisationally, we do this by providing a \"kit service\" to the competition team (the reference description of our responsibilities can be found in the ops manual ). Our overarching mission is to to empower teams to discover their ability to engineer amazing robots. The kit team is organised by the kit team committee, who ensure that the kit team's responsibilities are upheld. The kit team's operations are divided into a set of \"project teams\", each of which is: Overseen by the kit committee Takes ownership of its responsibilities. Autonomous, in that it organises itself, works out how it should operate interally, and how to prioritise its activities. A small group of volunteers (approx 3-10). Project Teams \u00b6 We are currently in the process of forming the following project teams: Support Team \u00b6 The support team provides technical support to students, teams and volunteers relating to The Kit . This can include: Providing support at events like kickstart, tech days and the competition Servicing support queries from students on the forums Developing and maintaining documentation for The Kit Determining when spare parts need to be shipped to teams (the Kit Assets Team will do the shipping) Interacting with mentors to resolve problems Infrastructure Team \u00b6 Provides and maintains managed hosting services and tooling to the rest of the kit team. Technologies maintained by this team might include: an environment in which the IDE software (maintained by the Dev Tooling team) can be run e.g. a cloud VM administration of Kit Team's usage of shared services e.g. github, CI The scope of the service provided by this team could perhaps be extended to the rest of the Student Robotics organisation in the future, thus covering technologies such as the website, forums, user database -- however this is not planned at present. Kit Assets Team \u00b6 The assets team is responsible for keeping track of the physical parts of the kit, as well as: Storing it Keeping it well maintained (e.g. fixing it between competitions) Shipping the kit to Kickstarts and teams, including spares Chasing non-returned kits and retrieving them Packing kits This includes any kit that may be solely allocated to 'development'. (For SR veterans: please note that the assets team is not responsible for managing SR assets that are not kit related -- e.g. parts of the arena, marketing materials etc. Also note that the assets team may choose to use whatever asset tracking methods they deem to be suitable -- they are not constrained to using any particular system.) Brain Team \u00b6 The brain team is responsible for the development and maintenance of the software that runs on the 'brain' part of the kit. It should provide documentation to the support team regarding how the end-user should use the software. The brain team should ensure that any features it releases to teams during a competition year continue to be available and usable until that competition year has completed. Dev Tooling Team \u00b6 Produces and maintains tooling for competitors to use to develop their robot software. This team is responsible for software that is not used 'on', or within, the physical kit that is shipped to teams. For example: an IDE a robot simulator live debugging tools e.g. the non-robot side of a remote debugging interface Hardware Strategy Team \u00b6 The kit includes a selection of hardware that teams use to construct their robot. It is the job of the hardware strategy team to ensure that this selection is the best it can be to fulfil the kit team's mission. The hardware strategy team defines what hardware is to be included in the kit each year. It does not perform hardware development of any kind -- instead it performs investigations and comes up with a strategy for how the hardware should develop. It then confers with the kit team committee to ascertain whether any new project teams need to be formed to support the development/maintenance any new items of kit. The hardware strategy team's investigations should involve looking at how the kit is currently being used, as well as what is technically feasible given the available resources (money, time). Firmware Team \u00b6 The firmware team is responsible for developing and maintaining the firmware for hardware included in the kit. The firmware team should ensure that any features it releases to teams during a competition year continue to be available until that competition year has completed. Robot Perception and Planning Team \u00b6 There are lots of aspects of robotics that extend beyond simple motor control and line-following. The robot perception and planning team's responsibility is to research, develop and maintain software that helps teams to make their robots perceive the world, as well as plan and execute motion through space.

See SR2017 Kit Collation Plan for a detailed plan. Process \u00b6 Each kit must go through the following process. Once the CHECKIN task has been performed for a given kit the remaining tasks can be run in parallel - especially the testing of different parts. The sequence of tasks is the same for all parts, however the specific requirements vary depending upon the part. CHECKIN - Unpack each kit and scan its contents into a single location in the Inventory. Any kit expected back from teams but not found is marked as missing. VISUAL - Visually inspect each part for damage. CLEAN - Clean each part. TEST - Test each part, where possible. CHECKOUT - Pack parts of the same type into boxes and update the Inventory. CHASEUP - [after event] Chase up missing parts. Throughout the process the state of each part is tracked through two fields: functional_condition (currently condition for backwards compatibility) and physical_condition . The functional_condition field has a value of either unknown , broken or working and is set based upon the outcome of the testing procedure carried out in the TEST task. The physical_condition field has one of the same three values that the functional_condition field can have, but it is set based upon a visual inspection of the part during the VISUAL task. We will only ship parts that have both a functional_condition and physical_condition of working . After the Kit Collation Event any parts with either a functional_condition or physical_condition of broken will be assessed to see whether they can be repaired or need to be replaced. CHECKIN \u00b6 Tools: Laptop, barcode/QR scanner Duration: 1 person day Remove each part from the kit box and move it into a checked-in directory in the Inventory. There is no need to worry about keeping track of which team the part came from, as this information can be retrieved from the Inventory at a later date if required. Mark each part as having functional_condition: unknown and physical_condition: unknown . If the Inventory shows any parts remaining in the kit box after all of the parts have been physically removed move them into a missing directory. VISUAL \u00b6 Tools: Laptop, barcode/QR scanner, label printer Duration: 2 person days Inspect parts for visible physical damage - mild cosmetic damage is not a concern. Also apply a new asset sticker if the current one is damaged or illegible. See the following table for example of visible physical damage for each part. Note that a case is considered to be damaged if a panel is cracked entirely in half (or close to it) or if a piece has broken off such that the board can be touched. Once the physical condition of the part has been assessed, update its physical_condition field to either working or broken . If it is broken, add a short description of the issue. Part Examples of physical damage Power board cuts, nicks or exposed copper on wires; large heatshrink slipping off of XT 60; loose screw terminal; case cracked/broken/missing screws; charring on board; connectors broken/full of stuff Motor board case cracked/broken, charring on board, connectors broken/full of stuff, button held down (try pressing the button - it should click) Servo board case cracked/broken, charring on board, blackened pins, connectors broken/full of stuff Ruggeduino case cracked/broken/missing screws, charring on board, connectors broken/full of stuff Screw shields bent pins, chewed up screw heads Odroid case cracked/broken, case hinge broken (try pulling apart at hinge end), connectors broken/full of stuff Tablet cracked screen USB charger bent pins, cracked case USB hub cracked case, damaged connector, loose parts rattling around inside WiFi dongle cracked case, damaged connector Webcam cracked case, damaged cable, damaged connector (missing stand is OK) Battery charger cracked case, damaged wires, large heatshrink slipping off of XT 60, missing cable tie, missing buttons Battery charger supply cracked case, damaged strain relief Battery bag torn stitching Battery Damaged wires, swollen to the point of being hard (squidgy is OK) Some parts are not tracked in the Inventory, but still require visual inspection.

CHECKIN - Unpack each kit and scan its contents into a single location in the Inventory. Any kit expected back from teams but not found is marked as missing. VISUAL - Visually inspect each part for damage. CLEAN - Clean each part. TEST - Test each part, where possible. CHECKOUT - Pack parts of the same type into boxes and update the Inventory. CHASEUP - [after event] Chase up missing parts. Throughout the process the state of each part is tracked through two fields: functional_condition (currently condition for backwards compatibility) and physical_condition . The functional_condition field has a value of either unknown , broken or working and is set based upon the outcome of the testing procedure carried out in the TEST task. The physical_condition field has one of the same three values that the functional_condition field can have, but it is set based upon a visual inspection of the part during the VISUAL task.

There is roughly a month between the two events to allow for repairs to be made and replacement parts purchased. At the end of Kit Packing the kits are loaded onto a pallet and shipped to our post handling provider. The kits will later be forwarded to the various Kickstart locations once the number of teams at each location has been confirmed. Process \u00b6 Before kits can be packed, there is some preparation work that must be done. Each of these tasks can be performed in parallel. WIRE - The wire must be cut to length. CAMCON - The camcon connectors must be counted out and bagged. LAYOUT - Boxes of each type of part must be laid out around the room. Once the preparation tasks have been completed the packing can commence. The process is strictly sequential for each kit, but multiple kits may be flowing through the process simultaneously. FILL - Fill a kit box with the parts. SCAN - Scan and move all of the tracked parts into the box in the Inventory. CHECK - Perform a check of the box contents and check off everything on a check list. JIFFY - Pack the box contents into Jiffy bags. PACK - Pack the Jiffy bags and remaining parts into the box with scrunched up paper. PALLET - Once all kits have been packed they can be loaded onto a pallet. WIRE \u00b6 Each kit contains 3 lengths of thick (1mm\u00b2) wire and 4 lengths of thin (0.5mm\u00b2) wire. Since the wire is purchased on 100m reels it needs to be cut to length and folded/knotted ready for packing. The wire needs to be cut into the following: 1.8m lengths of 1mm\u00b2 wire (red, black and blue) 3m lengths of 0.5mm\u00b2 wire (red, black, blue and yellow) After being cut the wires should be folded and knotted. A demonstration on how to do this will be given at the event. CAMCON \u00b6 Each kit contains various 'Camcon' pluggable terminal block connectors. These must be counted/weighed out and bagged up. Fill resealable plastic bags with the following: 10x 7.5mm camcons 7x 5mm camcons 1x 3.81mm camcon LAYOUT \u00b6 To help with the filling of kits, boxes of each constituent part should be placed around the room such that one can easily walk around filling a kit box without missing a part. All parts should be laid out, including the wire and camcons, in 'part stations'. See the canonical kit list for reference. Each part station must have a sign by it indicating the quantity to be packed. See the kit list for these quantities. Some parts are designated for development use only and should not be shipped to teams. Since the parts processed at the Kit Collation Event are a mix of development and non-development the development ones need to be filtered out from the part stations. The following types of part have some designated for development and they must be removed before commencing the FILL task: Power Board: Development have red PCBs Servo Board: Development have red PCBs Motor Board: Development have red PCBs USB Hub: Development have a sticker on them stating so FILL \u00b6 Once all preparation steps have been completed the kit boxes can be filled with parts. Take an empty Really Useful Box and traverse the room, placing parts in the box as you go. Each station will have a sign indicating the quantity to be placed in the box. SCAN \u00b6 Once a box has been filled with all kit parts the parts that are tracked in the Inventory must be scanned to check that they are marked as working (both functionally and physically) and are not development parts. If all of the parts are valid then they should all be moved into the Really Useful Box in the Inventory. Once all of the tracked parts have been moved, the box should be physically marked to indicate it has completed the SCAN task (stick a piece of coloured tape on it). CHECK \u00b6 After the tracked parts have been moved in the Inventory the box contents should be verified and checked off on a check list . Ideally this task would be performed by a different person to the one who filled it and the one who moved it in the Inventory - to reduce the likelihood of systematic errors. Once the check list is complete it must be left in the box. JIFFY \u00b6 A checked kit (one that has a completed check list in it) is ready to have its parts safely wrapped for transport. This is done by putting the vulnerable parts of the kit into Jiffy bags. There are two sizes of Jiffy bags: small brown ones and large white ones. Place the following parts into the specified bags and do NOT seal them. Place the filled bags back into the box. Small brown: 2x motor boards, 1x ruggeduino Small brown: 1x power board, 1x servo board, 2x WiFi dongles, 1x USB stick Small brown: 2x USB hubs, 1x Odroid Large white: 1x tablet Large white: 1x battery charger Large white: 1x battery charger PSU, 1x webcam, 1x tablet charger PACK \u00b6 To prevent the Jiffy bags and remaining parts from moving around too much in transit the empty space needs to be filled. This is done by tearing off a few metres of brown paper from a roll and scrunching it up. Some scrunched paper should be placed at the bottom of the box. The parts should be placed on top of this and finally a layer of scrunched paper should be placed on the top. The lid should be secured with two cable ties through the lids/handles in diagonally opposite corners. PALLET \u00b6 The final task, once all kits have been packed, is to load them onto a wooden pallet. The pallet will then be shipped to our post handling provider, who will forward them onto Kickstart venues at our instruction. A standard pallet is 1.2x1.0m and the load can generally be up to 2m high (what is known as a 'full' pallet). The kit boxes should be stacked on the pallet in layers of 6 (2x3). They are 0.2m high so 54 kits results in a load height of 1.8m. When all of the kits have been stacked they must be strapped to the pallet using polypropylene strapping and finally the whole assembly wrapped in stretch wrap.","title":"Kit Packing"},{"location":"kit-team/hardware/kit-packing/#kit-packing","text":"The purpose Kit Packing is to take the tested parts from the Kit Collation Event and pack them into kits ready for use by teams.

This is generally referred to as asset tracking. To allow SR to operate it is important that the location and state of all of its assets are known at all times. This chapter documents the high-level organisation aspects around SR asset tracking. It is not intended as a comprehensive user manual for the Inventory system, but rather how SR uses the system to track its assets. See the page on logistics-software for details of the inventory's datastore and tooling required to use it. The Inventory \u00b6 To record all of the necessary information regarding SR assets, all 1 assets are tracked in the Inventory. Unfortunately, due to historical use of the term, SR uses the term Inventory to refer to its asset tracking system. Normally inventory refers to a record of things that an organisation sells whereas assets are things that an organisation owns and uses to operate; tracked in its asset tracking system. It is not a big problem, but it is an unusual quirk to be aware of. Each asset, for example an individual webcam, has a corresponding record in the Inventory. Within this record various properties of the asset are held such that it is possible to unambiguously identify the matching asset from its Inventory record and conversely, identify the matching Inventory record from the asset. There is a one-to-one mapping of assets to Inventory records. Each type of asset is identified by its name ; for example a Logitech C270 webcam has the name webcam-logitech-c270 . All assets of the same type have the same name. When creating assets that do not have an existing name in the Inventory, care must be taken to ensure that the new name given to the asset is suitably descriptive. This ensures that it does not clash with future assets that are similar, but not the same; for example an asset with the name usb-charger is not descriptive enough, but usb-charger-a-500ma is. The Inventory primarily records the location of each asset, its value, its physical and functional condition, its asset code and a history of any changes made to any of these properties. Secondary to these properties, certain assets have extra information recorded such as MAC address (for assets that have an Ethernet or Bluetooth PHY), serial number and modification flags. To provide the one-to-one mapping between assets and their Inventory records, each asset/record pair have an asset code , which uniquely identifies them. An important part of maintaining this one-to-one mapping is ensuring that the asset code is suitably marked onto the asset such that it can be read in the future. Only property of SR is tracked in the Inventory; meaning that property of third parties must not be tracked in the Inventory. Asset Lifecycle \u00b6 For each asset that SR owns there is a reasonably well defined sequence of stages that it flows through during its lifetime. This flow is shown in the diagram below. graph LR create(Creation) commission(Commission) use(Use) test(Test) repair(Repair) modify(Modify) decommission(Decommission) disposal(Disposal) create-->commission commission-->use use-->modify use-->test use-->decommission modify-->test test-->repair test-->use test-->decommission repair-->test decommission-->disposal Creation \u00b6 When an asset is purchased or manufactured, a record must be entered into the Inventory. At this point a new asset code is automatically generated. The asset code must be marked onto the asset 2 . The asset code can be marked in the following ways: Printed paper label with QR code and text Dymo label with code128 barcode and text Handwritten with permanent marker UHF RFID tag 3 Programmed onto the asset (e.g. such that it is possible to read over USB) More than one of the above techniques can be used to provide redundancy. The ideal marking solution is both human and machine readable and should be durable. These criteria should be considered when deciding how to mark a particular asset. Programming the asset code onto the asset, where possible, provides a very high level of durability as there is no label or pen that can be damaged; However one has to physically plug a cable in to read the code. QR codes and barcodes have the advantage that physical contact with the asset is not required, but they do require the asset to be visible. UHF RFID tags provide the added benefit of allowing the asset code to be read even when they are not visible; for instance when it is in a box. Commission \u00b6 Some assets will require commissioning after they have been added to the Inventory. This can be best explained with an example: When a newly manufactured motor board is added to the Inventory it is yet to be programmed or fully tested (although it may have had some basic end-of-line testing performed upon it). Once it has been added to the Inventory, in the Creation stage, it is ready to be programmed and tested before being used. This initial programming and testing of the motor board is part of its commissioning process. Not all assets will require commissioning. Generally these are things such as USB hubs, where it is assumed that the manufacturer has suitably tested their product and there is no further programming required. Once an asset has been commissioned, its physical and functional condition must be updated appropriately in its record. In the case of assets that do not require any special commissioning procedure to be carried out, it should be assumed that they are both physically and functionally working and their records updated as such. Use \u00b6 Once an asset has been commissioned, or has been tested and shown to be working, it is ready to be used for its intended purpose. For the majority of assets this means that it will become part of a kit and ultimately be used by a team. During the use stage of an assets lifetime the majority of the updates to its record in the Inventory will be to keep track of its physical location; for example with a particular team. Occasionally there may also be other updates to its record required, such as adding a note to its description. Test \u00b6 The Inventory should, as far as is possible, represent the current state of all assets. However as time passes, the recorded physical and functional condition of a given asset will diverge from reality. To help rectify this, assets are regularly tested. For most assets this occurs once each year at the Kit Collation Event , run by the Hardware Production Coordinator . Assets that have been repaired or modified must also undergo testing. As in the commission stage, an asset's physical and functional condition must be updated appropriately in its record once it has been tested. If the asset is in full working order it is ready for use. If the asset is broken then it may be possible to repair it. In some situations it is either not cost effective or not possible to repair an asset. When this occurs, the asset is no longer useful to SR and will be decommissioned and disposed of. Repair \u00b6 If an asset is found to be broken, it may be possible to repair it. An example of this is a motor board that has a cracked case. It is trivial to replace the broken parts of the case and therefore allow the motor board to once again be used (after being retested). Modify \u00b6 Throughout the lifetime of an asset it may be necessary to perform modifications to it. This may be to add extra functionality, improve reliability or to fix a known problem. For most assets the opportunity to perform these modifications is at the Kit Collation Event, run by the Hardware Production Coordinator. If modifications are required they will perform them as necessary. When modifications are made to an asset it is important to track the changes in its Inventory record. These generally take the form of modification flags that indicate if a particular asset has been modified. If a modification across all assets of a given type is planed, for example soldering on an extra component to all motor boards, then all motor board Inventory records should be updated to indicate that none of them have received the modification. Once each asset is modified, its Inventory record must be updated appropriately. Decommission \u00b6 If an asset is broken and unrepairable or if an asset is simply no longer required then it must be decommissioned and then disposed of. The Kit Logistics Coordinator must only decommission and dispose of an asset when explicitly instructed to do so by the person responsible for the asset. TODO: Define who is responsible for each type of asset It must first be determined if the asset is to be sold/given away or if it is to be thrown away, as this affects the decommissioning process. Some assets will have specific decommissioning requirements, however in all cases there are common steps that must be taken. For assets that are to be sold or given to a third party all SR logos and 'property of' messages must be removed/obliterated. This ensures that future owners and users of the assets do not mistakenly think that it is property of SR and that SR itself does not mistakenly think that it is property belonging to SR. Once an asset has been fully decommissioned its Inventory record must be updated with a modification flag that indicates that it has been decommissioned. Disposal \u00b6 Once an asset has been decommissioned, it must be either sold/given away or thrown away, depending upon what was previously agreed when starting the decommissioning process. If an asset is to be sold the Kit Logistics Coordinator will work with the person previously responsible for that asset to determine the best way to sell the asset. If the estimated value of the asset at the time of selling is above \u00a350 then the trustees are to be be consulted. If an asset is to be thrown away the Kit Logistics Coordinator will work with the person previous responsible for that asset to determine if there are any special requirements regarding its disposal; for example WEEE regulations for electronics. Also if the value of the asset, as shown in its Inventory record, is above \u00a350 then the trustees are to be consulted. Once an asset has been disposed of, either via selling/giving away or by throwing away, its Inventory record must be removed from the Inventory. Only records that have a decommissioned modification flag should be removed from the Inventory. This is not strictly true as certain low-value assets are not tracked. A general rule-of-thumb is that anything under \u00a35 is not tracked. \u21a9 There was historically a concept of 'deferred labelling', where a record was added to the Inventory and the asset labelled at a later time. This approach is no longer used as it can result in assets going unlabelled. \u21a9 Currently in the planning stage. \u21a9","title":"Asset Tracking"},{"location":"kit-team/logistics/asset-tracking/#asset-tracking","text":"One of the responsibilities of the Kit Logistics Coordinator is to maintain a record of the location and state of all SRs assets. This is generally referred to as asset tracking. To allow SR to operate it is important that the location and state of all of its assets are known at all times. This chapter documents the high-level organisation aspects around SR asset tracking. It is not intended as a comprehensive user manual for the Inventory system, but rather how SR uses the system to track its assets. See the page on logistics-software for details of the inventory's datastore and tooling required to use it.","title":"Asset Tracking"},{"location":"kit-team/logistics/asset-tracking/#the-inventory","text":"To record all of the necessary information regarding SR assets, all 1 assets are tracked in the Inventory. Unfortunately, due to historical use of the term, SR uses the term Inventory to refer to its asset tracking system. Normally inventory refers to a record of things that an organisation sells whereas assets are things that an organisation owns and uses to operate; tracked in its asset tracking system. It is not a big problem, but it is an unusual quirk to be aware of. Each asset, for example an individual webcam, has a corresponding record in the Inventory. Within this record various properties of the asset are held such that it is possible to unambiguously identify the matching asset from its Inventory record and conversely, identify the matching Inventory record from the asset. There is a one-to-one mapping of assets to Inventory records. Each type of asset is identified by its name ; for example a Logitech C270 webcam has the name webcam-logitech-c270 . All assets of the same type have the same name. When creating assets that do not have an existing name in the Inventory, care must be taken to ensure that the new name given to the asset is suitably descriptive. This ensures that it does not clash with future assets that are similar, but not the same; for example an asset with the name usb-charger is not descriptive enough, but usb-charger-a-500ma is. The Inventory primarily records the location of each asset, its value, its physical and functional condition, its asset code and a history of any changes made to any of these properties. Secondary to these properties, certain assets have extra information recorded such as MAC address (for assets that have an Ethernet or Bluetooth PHY), serial number and modification flags. To provide the one-to-one mapping between assets and their Inventory records, each asset/record pair have an asset code , which uniquely identifies them.

No one else is expected to follow these procedures, they are for internal documentation only. Shipping kits to Kickstarts \u00b6 To provide sufficient time for problems/delays, kits should be shipped to Kickstart locations no later than 1 week before Kickstart. Shipping the kits many weeks in advance may not be possible due to limited storage requirements at some Kickstart locations. First ensure that the Kickstart Event Coordinator is aware of the paperwork requirements (handout forms and disclaimers). Request the following information from the Kickstart Event Coordinator: Name of Local Kickstart Event Coordinator Email address of Local Kickstart Event Coordinator Number of teams attending Name of person able to receive the kit (if not the Local Kickstart Event Coordinator) Email address of person able to receive the kit (if not the Local Kickstart Event Coordinator) Phone number of person able to receive the kit Address to ship the kit to For each Kickstart: Ensure that the Local Kickstart Event Coordinator, or the person that they are delegating kit management to, has received the necessary training (to be defined). Identify the kits to be shipped in the Inventory and move them into an appropriate in-transit sub directory (e.g. in-transit/to-oxford-ks ). Instruct UK Postbox to forward the correct items to the recipient. Once UK Postbox have forwarded on the kits, email the LKEC and the recipient (if not the LKEC) with the tracking number/link and a list of kit asset numbers shipped to them. Ask them to report back when they have received the shipment and doubled checked that they have the expected kits. Once the kits have been delivered, move them in the Inventory to an appropriate sub directory (e.g. kickstart-venues/oxford ). Email details of what kits are where to the Kickstart Event Coordinator so that they can prepare handout forms for each of the Local Kickstart Event Coordinators. After Kickstart, request scanned copies of the handout form and disclaimers from all of the Kickstarts from the Kickstart Event Coordinator (who will then request them from the Local Kickstart Coordinators). Move each kit into an appropriate sub directory in the Inventory based upon which team it was given to (e.g. move a kit to teams/2017/srz ). Shipping kits to teams that didn't attend a Kickstart \u00b6 The operations manual currently requires that the Kit Logistics Coordinator ensures that kits are available to be collected by a courier no later than 2 week after Kickstart. Begin by requesting the following information from the Team Coordinator for the teams that didn't attend a Kickstart and ask them to confirm that the details are correct via the appropriate local teams coordinator: Name of local teams coordinator Email of local teams coordinator (so that any further queries and an email containing a tracking link doesn't have to go via the Team Coordinator) Name of recipient Email of recipient Phone number of recipient (ideally a mobile number as that's what couriers prefer) Address including: School name Number (if applicable) Street Town/City County Postcode For each team that needs a kit: Identify the kit to be shipped in the Inventory and move it to an appropriate in-transit sub directory (e.g. in-transit/to-srz ). Once the details have been confirmed, instruct UK Postbox to forward the correct item to the team. Once UK Postbox have forwarded on the kit, email the local teams coordinator with the tracking number/link so that they can pass it onto the team. Get them to ask the team to inform them when the kit has been delivered. Once the kit has been delivered, move the kit in the Inventory to the appropriate team sub directory (e.g. teams/2017/srz ). Managing kits not collected at Kickstart \u00b6 Some teams may not turn up at Kickstart, therefore leaving their kit uncollected. This kit needs to either be stored safely by someone nearby or returned to UK Postbox. The kit will most likely make its way to a team (either the originally intended recipient or otherwise) in the week or two after Kickstart. If a responsible person in attendance at the Kickstart event (for example the Local Kickstart Coordinator) is willing to store the kit for a week or two, and is able to make it available for courier collection, then this is preferable. If it is not possible to store the kit locally, it must be returned to UK Postbox ASAP. A Return Shipping Pack must be used to package the kit for return. Someone (possibly the venue) will need to make the kit available for courier collection in the day or two following Kickstart. Reallocating kits from drop-outs \u00b6 We need to ship kits from one team to another when a team drops out. TBD. Shipping spares/replacements \u00b6 When parts of the kit break teams need replacements. The Kit Logistics Coordinator needs to ship these spares/replacements to teams when instructed to do so by the Kit Support Coordinator. Begin by requesting the following information from the Team Coordinator for the team that needs replacement parts shipping to them and ask them to confirm that the details are correct via the appropriate local teams coordinator: Name of local teams coordinator Email of local teams coordinator (so that any further queries and an email containing a tracking link doesn't have to go via the Team Coordinator) Name of recipient Email of recipient Phone number of recipient (ideally a mobile number as that's what couriers prefer) Address including: School name Number (if applicable) Street Town/City County Postcode Identify the replacement parts to be shipped in the Inventory (as defined by the Kit Support Coordinator) and move them to an appropriate in-transit sub directory (e.g. in-transit/to-srz ). Package the parts into a cardboard box, using Jiffy bags, bubblewrap or similar to protect the parts. Once the details have been confirmed, arrange for the package to be collected from yourself and delivered to the team. Once you have the tracking number from the courier, email the local teams coordinator with the tracking number/link so that they can pass it onto the team. Get them to ask the team to inform them when the kit has been delivered. Once the kit has been delivered, move the kit in the Inventory to the appropriate team sub directory (e.g. teams/2017/srz ). Shipping kits to storage at the end of the competition \u00b6 At the end of the competition we have the majority of the kits returned to us. The Competition Team Coordinator is responsible for managing the return process. The Kit Logistics Coordinator can aid in this process and is responsible for shipping the kits to storage after they have been returned. TBD. Ensuring the timely return of kits not returned at the competition \u00b6 Some teams will have been given permission to retain their kit for a while after the competition. The teams are responsible for arranging and paying for a courier to return the kit to us. The Kit Logistics Coordinator is responsible for assisting teams in this process and ensuring that all kits are returned by the 1 st June of the same year that the competition was held in. TBD. Shipping of non-team kits and development tools to volunteers \u00b6 Non-team kits (those that are classed as development, support, PR or local) and development tools need to be shipped around as deemed appropriate by the person responsible for their allocation. That being the Kit Coordinator for development kits and tools, the Kit Support Coordinator for support kits, the PR coordinator for PR kits and the Team Coordinator for local kits. TBD. Shipping of non-kit assets \u00b6 Most assets are kit related. However, a few assets are not kits or parts thereof. This is mostly competition hardware such as arena walls. The Kit Logistics Coordinator is also responsible for shipping these non-kit assets when required.

Purpose \u00b6 The role of the LSM is to maintain the operation of the legacy server inherited by Student Robotics prior to the formation of the CIO. The legacy server is defined as the Linode server known as 'saffron'. This machine currently hosts a selection of services, the management of which fall under multiple roles in the CIO organisational structure. Due to the multiplicity of the legacy server, it is desired for it to be retired and replaced with a system that allows for running of services managed by separate roles to be fully independent of one another. Since there is the intention to ultimately retire the legacy server, this role has an inherently finite lifetime. Once the server has been retired this role will cease to exist. Note that this role does not allow for any further development of features specific to the legacy server itself; it is purely a maintenance role to keep the server operational. This does not preclude development of the services currently running on the legacy server by the relevant roles and the LSM providing support to those roles as necessary. Responsibilities \u00b6 Ensuring the continued availability of all services hosted on the legacy server. Application of security patches/update where necessary.
