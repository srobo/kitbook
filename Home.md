# Student Robotics Arena Manager

This is the Arena Manager's documentation. The Arena Manager is responsible for constructing and de-constructing the arenas at the competition.

## Tasks

The following tasks are generally applicable from one year to the next. As the responsibilities of the role change these tasks should be updated to suit.

Pre-competition (in no particular order):

 * Specify the following and communicate requirements to the Production Manager, who will handle hire:
    * Network equipment (switches, cables, etc). Work with Competition Software Coordinator to spec.
    * Power equipment.
    * Screens and screen mounts. Work with Competition Software Coordinator to spec.
    * Desks and chairs for the staging and match coordination areas.
    * Crowd barriers for use around the arenas and the staging area.
 * Specify and order tape. A non-exhaustive list:
    * Coloured gaffer for corner related things (e.g. game props, corner markings, robot badges).
    * Double-sided for carpet laying.
    * Double-sided tape for marker application (arena and tokens).
    * Black gaffer tape for carpet edge and other misc uses.
    * White gaffer tape for game props (if required) and other misc uses.
 * Specify and order carpet.
 * Specify and order libkoki markers (game dependent) and arena labels. (Check arena labels from the previous year to assess suitability.)
 * Specify and order materials for game props (e.g. cardboard boxes).
 * Work with Competition Software Coordinator to arrange for display computers to be available during set up.
 * Specify and source/order arena walls (we already own some, so only required if they change).

Setup (roughly in time order):

 * Install carpet.
 * Install arena walls.
 * Install markings on arena floor in accordance with the game rules, to denote the starting positions of props and to provide human readable markings (corner numbers).
 * Install crowd barriers around arenas and staging area.
 * Install labels on the outside of each arena to identify the arena (e.g. 'A' and 'B').
 * Install fire extinguishers (1 per arena).
 * Install network for corner screens and match coordination area.
 * Install power for corner screens and match coordination area.
 * Install the corner screens.
 * Install the display hardware onto the back of the screens.
 * Install staging area desks and one-way system (tape on the floor + signs).
 * Install staging area management bay, for the storage of competition USB keys and robot badges.
