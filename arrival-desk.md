# Arrival Desk Volunteer

The arrival desk is a location for co-ordinating with teams and volunteers at
the start of the competition. There are two aims:

 * Team entry/exit recording
 	* Arrival desk staff will have sign-in / sign-out sheet(s) for team leaders to
record that their teams have arrived and when they leave. Reception will direct
team leaders and robot kit to the desk; you should get the team-leader to sign the sheet.
 * Stripping restricted parts of robots on entry
 	* You should inform the team-leader that we remove the following SR-issued items from
teams on entry and that they *must* arrange for their team to deliver those items to the desk:

 		* 2 x Batteries
 		* 1 x Battery chargers
		* 1 x Battery charging bags
		* 1 x Battery charging power supply unit (PSU)

	* Competitors with kit will turn up (from reception, or from team leaders). You
should ask them whether they have any of the items above on them, and if
they do, retain them. If they're embedded in a robot, get the competitor to
extract them. Retained items should be put in a RUB or on the desk; someone
from helpdesk will move them upstairs.
 * Collecting broken kit parts from teams
	* Throughout the year, teams will have ended up with broken pieces of kit. For the most part, we have told these teams to return this broken kit during the competition. There will be a list indicating which teams should be returning broken kit. You should refer to this list as part of the "kit stripping" activity to ensure you collect any broken parts from the team.
 * Provisioning arriving volunteers with information
 	* Volunteers will be turning up, at the start of the day and
throughout the competition. They need to be provided with the t-shirt they
ordered and a printed schedule of what they're doing for the day.
 * Regularly letting the competition software coordinator know which teams have arrived
	* The competition software coordinator needs to have an accurate picture of which teams have arrived (and more importantly, which teams are not at the competition!) to plan the match schedules. The arrivals desk is responsible for periodically providing a list of teams that are present.

After initial influx, the reception will absorb this role.

The following flow is an outline of the processes described above:
